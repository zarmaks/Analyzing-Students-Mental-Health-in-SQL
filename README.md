In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of a university student database to identify factors affecting mental health among international students. Utilizing SQL, I extracted and analyzed data to uncover trends and correlations. The project culminated in the creation of visualizations using Pandas and Matplotlib, which provided clear, actionable insights. My work demonstrates a strong command of data querying, analysis, and visualization techniques.

Key Achievements:

Executed complex SQL queries to analyze student data.
Interpreted data to identify key mental health factors.
Developed visualizations that succinctly communicate findings.
This project reflects my ability to leverage data to inform meaningful conclusions in an educational context.
